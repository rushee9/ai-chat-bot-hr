What personal information does the Company collect and use?

Our goal is to connect you with the most suitable employment opportunities, tailored specifically to your profile. To achieve this, we gather and utilize personal information, categorized as follows:

Identity Data includes your name, username, title, date of birth, and identity verification documents.

Contact Data encompasses your billing and delivery addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.

Qualifications and Working Experience Data covers your CV or resume, educational background, attended training courses and internships, work authorization documents, and any additional information you’ve included in your resume or CV, such as photos and videos from video interviews or training sessions.

Social Media Data refers to the information available on your social media profiles, like LinkedIn, and any other details you publicly share or directly provide to us from your social media accounts.

Technical Data consists of internet protocol (IP) addresses you use to access our Portal and other services, cookie details (as described in our Cookies Policy), your login data (including access times, dates, and durations), browser type and version, device time zone settings and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform of your device, and other technologies on the devices you use to access our Portal.

Phone Calls Data captures the details of your interactions with us over the phone, including the caller ID, call time, date, and duration.

Profile Data comprises your username and password, interests, preferences, feedback, and survey responses.

Marketing Communications Data tracks your engagement with our email, SMS, phone, and other marketing initiatives.

In certain instances, we may also collect ‘special categories of data’ or ‘sensitive information’, which we refer to as Sensitive Data. This might include (where applicable) information about any disabilities to ensure workplace accommodations, along with diversity-related data (such as racial or ethnic origin, among others).

The scope of information we collect depends on specific circumstances, local laws, and requirements, all aimed at providing you with employment opportunities that align with your individual situation and interests.

How do we collect your personal information?

The personal information we gather about you is sourced from the application forms or any other documents you provide to us, as well as your interactions with us and others during the application process.

Occasionally, we may also obtain personal information about you from third parties. This could include recruitment agencies we partner with, other entities within our corporate group if your information was transferred to us from another entity within our network, or from public sources like LinkedIn and Twitter, always ensuring compliance with relevant laws.

Do you have to give us the personal details we ask for?

Providing your personal information to us is not mandatory. However, without receiving the necessary minimum information from you, our ability to collaborate or deliver our services to you would be constrained. This includes assessing your suitability for positions we offer.

Additionally, choosing to provide only limited personal information may restrict the range of services available to you from our end.

Do we use artificial intelligence in our operations?

Yes, we incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into our processes when appropriate. However, it’s important to note that we do not engage in any form of automated decision-making or profiling using your personal information that results in legal or similarly significant effects on you. Automated decision-making refers to decisions made entirely through technological means without human involvement, while profiling involves analyzing personal information with technology to assess certain personal aspects.

Our approach to utilizing technology involves a blend of AI and human oversight. We leverage various technologies to process and analyze data, but human judgment is always a key component of our decision-making process. These technologies are employed to assist our skilled team in handling the extensive data and applications we receive, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.

We might employ AI, including machine learning, logic- or knowledge-based systems, and statistical methods, to enhance the services we provide to you and our clients. However, any decision that has a direct impact on you is made by our professional recruiters, ensuring that the use of AI does not replace human discretion and judgment.

For instance, in the process of identifying suitable candidates for our clients, we may use AI to analyze our candidate database based on criteria such as job titles, availability, skill sets, assessment scores, and preferred locations. This aids in creating a curated shortlist of candidates who closely match the client’s needs. Yet, the final decision-making authority rests with our human experts, who ensure that the application of AI complements our commitment to personal and professional service delivery.
